# recipe-finder
Side project to identify ingredients with a camera and provide the user with a list of possible recipes.
I wanted an introduction to OpenCV and a chance to work on my Python skills while creating something substantial.
### Goals
Currently WIP:
* Recognize the ingredient first
* Take photos of ingredients you want to use; then be provided with a bunch of recipes (atm could use a web scraper and OpenCV)
* Other features could include creating and saving your own recipes, servings conversions
* Functionality for reverse; take image of the completed dish and get recipes for it
* **LONG-TERM**: Potentially port to mobile application
